 Module 5 of Boot Camp

This is the submitted assignment for Module 5 of the Data Analytics Boot Camp by Chris Burk. You can contact me at burk992 at gmail.

# Code sourcing

I watched some Youtube videos and played with existing code on Github. I also had to use materials from the matplotlib documentation and bits of code clipped from "Solved" exercises in class. 

# Final notes

I am turning this in partially for a later regrade. I am missing the IQR and analysis. I unfortunately moved and started a new job all in the last couple of days so time ran out.
